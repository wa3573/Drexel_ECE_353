  BUILD:
To build, simply type "make". This will load the Makefile and initate the "all" 
target.

  CLEAN:
To clean, type "make_clean"

  USE:
Run the server using the command "./server". This will open the server to 
receive connections. Once the server opens, in a separate terminal, type
"./client". This will open the client, which will attempt to connect to the
server. Upon successful connection user will be prompted to enter a single 
letter choice. 

'r' will check for (read) the messages that have been sent to
it. 

's' prompts the user to enter a message, they may enter any length message
but it will be truncated to 512 characters (i.e. 512 bytes). Once the user has
completed the message, the may press CTRL+D to signal EOF. 

'q' will disconnect from the server and then exit.

At any point, the client may press CTRL+C, which will disconnect from the
server and exit the program.

Similarly, the server can be closed using the CTRL+C

Bug: killing the client process via the "kill -9 <PID>" command will result
in the server becoming unreachable, presumably locked in a blocking read()
or write(). So, behaviour for externally killed processes is undefined.
