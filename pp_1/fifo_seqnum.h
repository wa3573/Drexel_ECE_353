/* Recall that the data in pipes and FIFOs is a byte stream: boundaries between multiple 
 * messages are not preserved. So, when multiple messages are delivered to the server by the clients, 
 * the reader (server) and the writer (client) must agree on some convention for separating the 
 * messages. We use fixed-length messages and have the server always read messages of this fixed length to solve the 
 * above problem. Though simple to program, the solution is brittle in the sense that if one of the clients 
 * accidentally and deliberately send a message that is not the right length, all subsequent messages will be out of
 * step. The server cannot recover from this situation easily.
